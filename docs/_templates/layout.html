{# This extension of the 'layout.html' prevents documentation for previous
   versions of Astropy to be indexed by bots, e.g. googlebot or bing bot,
   by inserting a robots meta tag into pages that are not in the stable or
   latest branch.

   It assumes that the documentation is built by and hosted on readthedocs.org:
   1. Readthedocs.org has a global robots.txt and no option for a custom one.
   2. The readthedocs app passes additional variables to the template context,
   one of them being `version_slug`. This variable is a string computed from
   the tags of the branches that are selected to be built. It can be 'latest',
   'stable' or even a unique stringified version number.

   For more information, please refer to:

  {% if not version_slug in to_be_indexed  %}
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">

{# This extension of the 'layout.html' is useful if the docs
   are built and hosted on readthedocs.org

   The readthedocs app passes additional variables to the template context.

   The variable 'version_slug' passed by the RTD app  is a string computed
   from the version control tags. It can be 'latest', 'stable' or the
   version number as a string.

   Check out '/readthedocs/builds/version_slug.py' in 'github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org'
